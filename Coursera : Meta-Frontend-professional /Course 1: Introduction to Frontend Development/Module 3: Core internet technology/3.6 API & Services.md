# APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) 🔄

- **Definition**: Set of functions and procedures for creating applications that access features or data of an operating system, application, or service.
- **Purpose**: Bridge between different components or systems, also known as a gateway or middleware.
- **Types of APIs**:
  - **Browser or Web APIs**: Extend browser functionality, e.g., DOM API, geolocation API.
  - **RESTful (REST) APIs**: Provide data for web and mobile apps, follow REST principles.
  - **Sensor-Based APIs**: Interconnect physical sensors, used in IoT (Internet of Things) devices.

**Common Web API Examples** 🌐

- **DOM API**: Represents HTML document as a tree of nodes.
- **Geolocation API**: Returns browser's coordinates.
- **Fetch API**: Fetches data.
- **Canvas API**: Renders graphics.
- **History API**: Manages browsing history.
- **Web Storage API**: Stores data on client side.

**RESTful API** 🚀

- **Definition**: Uses REST principles for building efficient APIs.
- **Functionality**: Sends and receives data to/from a centralized database.
- **Operations**: GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (delete data).
- **Design Practices**: Follows good design practices for discoverable interfaces.

**How RESTful APIs Work** 🔄

- **Endpoints**: Specifies how resources can be accessed, built into the URL when accessing the API.
- **Response**: Can be full web pages or data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.

**Role of APIs for Web Developers** 👩‍💻

- **Extending Abilities**: Use APIs to extend the abilities of systems.
- **Bridging Components**: Act as a bridge between different components.

**Conclusion** 🎯

- Web developers frequently work with different types of APIs.
- APIs are crucial for extending system abilities and bridging components.
