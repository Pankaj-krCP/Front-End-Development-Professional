# ðŸš— JavaScript Object Methods Cheat Sheet

## Introduction to Objects

In JavaScript, an **object** consists of key-value pairs known as properties. These properties can include various data types, including functions. When a function is a property of an object, it is referred to as a **method**.

## Adding Properties to Objects

You can add new properties to objects using the dot notation and the assignment operator.

### Example: Adding Properties

```javascript
var car = {};
car.color = "red"; // Adding a property
car.mileage = 98765; // Adding another property
console.log(car); // Output: { color: "red", mileage: 98765 }
```

## Adding Methods to Objects

A method is simply a property that holds a function. Methods can only be accessed through the object they belong to.

### Example: Adding Methods

```javascript
var car = {};

// Adding properties
car.mileage = 98765;
car.color = "red";

// Adding a method
car.turnTheKey = function () {
  console.log("The engine is running");
};

// Adding another method
car.lightsOn = function () {
  console.log("The lights are on");
};

console.log(car);
// Output: { mileage: 98765, color: "red", turnTheKey: [Function], lightsOn: [Function] }
```

## Using Methods

To call a method, you need to access it through the object and use parentheses to invoke it.

### Example: Calling Methods

```javascript
car.turnTheKey(); // Output: The engine is running
car.lightsOn(); // Output: The lights are on
```

## Key Points

- **Properties**: Key-value pairs that can hold various data types.
- **Methods**: Functions that are properties of an object, accessed through the object.

## Quick Reference

- **Adding Property**: `object.property = value                     ;`
- **Adding Method**: `object.methodName = function() { /* code */ } ;`
- **Calling Method**: `object.methodName()                          ;`
