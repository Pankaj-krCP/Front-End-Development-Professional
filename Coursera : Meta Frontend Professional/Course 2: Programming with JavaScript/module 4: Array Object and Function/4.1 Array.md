# ðŸš‚ Understanding Arrays in JavaScript

## Introduction

JavaScript has a piece of functionality that allows you to store and rearrange sequenced collections of items. This is called an **array**.

## Why array

### Creating Variables

Imagine a toy freight train using JavaScript. Each carriage has a number painted on its side, starting from 0. You can assign some cargo to each carriage:

```javascript
var carriage0 = "wheat";
```

When you inspect the contents of `carriage0`, you'll get back the word "wheat".

### Problems with Multiple Variables

If you create multiple variables for each carriage, it can get cumbersome, especially when dealing with multiple trains:

```javascript
var carriage0 = "wheat";
var carriage1 = "coal";
var carriage2 = "iron";
var carriage3 = "timber";
var carriage4 = "copper";
```

Introducing another train with similar variable names would be confusing:

```javascript
var train2carriage0 = "oil";
var train2carriage1 = "grain";
```

## ðŸ§© Introducing Arrays

To manage collections of items more efficiently, we use arrays. Arrays allow us to group a sequence of variables in a collection.

### Creating an Array

Use the array literal syntax, which is an opening square bracket `[` followed by a closing one `]`. This signals that we're providing a collection of items:

```javascript
var train1 = [];
```

### Adding Items to an Array

Let's add carriages to the `train1` array:

```javascript
var train1 = ["wheat", "coal", "iron", "timber", "copper"];
```

### Accessing Array Items

JavaScript automatically gives each item in the array a number starting from 0, which corresponds to its place in the sequence. You can access each carriage using these numbers:

```javascript
console.log(train1[0]); // Outputs: wheat
```
