# Bugs and Errors

- **Bug**: Makes the code behave unexpectedly but doesn't stop it from running.
- **Error**: Stops the program due to a fault in the code.

## Common Error Types

1. **Syntax Error**: Invalid JavaScript code that cannot be read.
2. **Reference Error**: Occurs when trying to use variables that haven't been declared.
3. **Type Error**: Thrown when trying to perform an operation on a non-supported data type.
4. **Range Error**: Happens when providing a value to a function that is out of the allowed range of acceptable input values.

### Examples

- **Syntax Error Example**: `var a "there's no assignment operator here";`
- **Reference Error Example**: `console.log(username);`
- **Type Error Example**: `"hello".pop();`
- **Range Error Example**: `(10).toString(100);`

### There are some other errors in JavaScript.

1. **AggregateError**
2. **Error**
3. **InternalError**
4. **URIError**

## Handling Errors

- JavaScript stops execution when an error occurs, reporting it in the console.
- Error reporting helps identify and fix issues in the code.

- **Try-Catch**: Wraps code inside a try block and catches any error thrown.
