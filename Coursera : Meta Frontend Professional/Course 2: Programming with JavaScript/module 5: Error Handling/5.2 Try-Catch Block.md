# Error Handling in JavaScript

- **Error**: Stops the program due to a fault in the code.
- **Bug**: Makes the code behave unexpectedly but doesn't stop it from running.

**Statements for Error Handling**

- **Try-Catch**: Wraps code inside a try block and catches any error thrown.

## Using Try-Catch

- **Throw**: Forces an error to be thrown.
- **Try Block**: Contains the code to be tested for errors.
- **Catch Block**: Catches the error thrown from the try block.
- **Error Object**: Represents the actual error thrown.
- **finally**: Always execute either error occurs or not.

### Example try-catch

**Code**:

```javascript
try {
  console.log(a + b);
} catch (err) {
  console.log("There was an error: " + err.message);
} finally {
  console.log("My program does not stop");
}
```

**Output**:

```
ReferenceError: a is not defined
My program does not stop
```

### Example using Throw

**Code**:

```javascript
throw new ReferenceError("My custom error message");
```

**Output**:

```
ReferenceError: My custom error message
```

## Benefits of Error Handling

- Prevents program from stopping when an error occurs.
- Allows you to catch and handle errors gracefully.
