# Undefined, Null and Empty Values in JavaScript

## Null

- Represents intentional absence of an object value.
- Return value of some built-in JavaScript methods when object is not found.

## Undefined

- Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- Default return value of functions unless specified otherwise.
- Output by console.log when no value is returned.
- Automatically assigned to variables declared without a value.

## Empty String

- A string without any characters inside it.
- Can be created with single or double quotes with no characters between them.

## Best Practices

- Assign values to variables when declaring them to avoid undefined values.
- Understand that JavaScript uses undefined as a placeholder for values that are not yet specified.
- Don't use undefined on your own. let's leave on javascript uses of undefined.
