# Defensive Programming 🛡️

**Definition:** Defensive programming is a practice where you assume that things will go wrong in your code, and you proactively handle potential errors by checking inputs and conditions before they cause issues.

**Why Use It?** It helps prevent errors and makes your code more robust by anticipating and handling unexpected scenarios.

**Key Points:**

- **Assumption of Fault:** Assume that inputs to functions may be of the wrong type or value.
- **Proactive Checks:** Perform checks to ensure inputs meet expected criteria.
- **Error Prevention:** By catching potential issues early, you reduce the likelihood of errors.

**Example Refactoring:**

```javascript
function letterFinder(word, match) {
  var condition1 = typeof word == "string" && word.length >= 2;
  var condition2 = typeof match == "string" && match.length == 1;
  if (condition1 && condition2) {
    for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
      if (word[i] == match) {
        console.log("Found the", match, "at", i);
      } else {
        console.log("---No match found at", i);
      }
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Please pass correct arguments to the function");
  }
}
```

**Refactored Function:**

- Check if `word` and `match` are strings and meet length criteria.
- Use separate conditions for readability.
- Provide informative error message for invalid inputs.

**Usage:**

- `letterFinder([],[])` will log "Please pass correct arguments to the function" due to invalid types.
- `letterFinder("cat","c")` will log the positions where 'c' is found in "cat".

This approach enhances the function's reliability and makes it easier to maintain.
