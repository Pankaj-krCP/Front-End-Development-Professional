## Introduction to Loops in JavaScript 🚀

In our everyday life, we often perform repetitive tasks, such as closing each button when putting on a shirt or counting down from ten to one before celebrating. Similarly, in JavaScript, loops help us execute a block of code multiple times until a condition is met.

## Understanding Loops 🔄

- **Conditional IF Statement**: Executes a block of code if a certain condition is met, but only runs once.
- **Loops**: Execute repeated blocks of code until a certain condition is satisfied. They are similar to conditionals but include an additional parameter called a loop counter.

## Why Use Loops? 🤔

Loops are efficient for repetitive tasks. For example, counting from 1 to 100 using a loop requires fewer lines of code compared to logging each number individually.

## Types of Loops in JavaScript 🌟

#### 1. **For Loop** 🌀

- Used to loop a block of code a certain number of times.
- Structure:
  ```javascript
  for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log("Go!");
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `let i = 1`: Initialize the counter variable.
  - `i <= 3`: Condition to continue looping.
  - `i++`: Increment the counter variable.
  - Outputs: 1, 2, 3, Go!

#### 2. **While Loop** 🔁

- Similar to the for loop but with different structure.
- Structure:
  ```javascript
  let counter = 3;
  while (counter > 0) {
    console.log(counter);
    counter--;
  }
  console.log("Happy New Year!");
  ```
- Explanation:
  - Initialize `counter` variable.
  - `while (counter > 0)`: Condition to continue looping.
  - `counter--`: Decrement the counter variable.
  - Outputs: 3, 2, 1, Happy New Year!

### Key Points to Remember 📝

- **Counter Variable**: Vital for controlling the loop's start and termination.
- **Exit Condition**: Prevents the loop from running indefinitely.
- **Loop Body**: Contains the code to be executed on each iteration.

### Using Loops for Efficient Code 💡

- Loops automate repetitive tasks, making the code concise and efficient.
- Both `for` and `while` loops can achieve similar results, but `for` loops are often easier for beginners due to their self-contained nature.

### Example: Countdown with For Loop ⏳

```javascript
for (let i = 10; i > 0; i--) {
  console.log(i);
}
console.log("Happy New Year!");
```

### Example: Countdown with While Loop 🕰️

```javascript
let counter = 10;
while (counter > 0) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter--;
}
console.log("Happy New Year!");
```
