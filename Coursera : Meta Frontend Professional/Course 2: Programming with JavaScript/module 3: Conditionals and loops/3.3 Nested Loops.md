## Nested Loops in JavaScript

Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times, which is useful for tasks like processing datasets. When you need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, you can use nested loopsâ€”loops within loops. Let's break down some key points and examples of nested loops:

---

### Practical Example of Nested Loops

Suppose you want to create a two-week plan for weekdays (Monday to Friday). You need to output each day number and its associated week.

- **Outer Loop**: Loops over the weeks.
- **Inner Loop**: Loops over the days.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
for (var week = 1; week <= 2; week++) {
  for (var day = 1; day <= 5; day++) {
    console.log("Week " + week + ", Day " + day);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
Week 1, Day 1
Week 1, Day 2
...
Week 2, Day 5
```

### Summer Months Over Two Years

Another example is outputting summer months (June, July, August) for two years (2023, 2024).

#### Code Example:

```javascript
for (var year = 2023; year < 2025; year++) {
  console.log(year);
  for (var month = 6; month < 9; month++) {
    console.log(" - " + month);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
2023
 - 6
 - 7
 - 8
2024
 - 6
 - 7
 - 8
```

### Custom Multiplication Table

Nested loops can also be used to create a multiplication table.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
for (var firstNum = 0; firstNum < 2; firstNum++) {
  for (var secondNum = 0; secondNum < 10; secondNum++) {
    console.log(
      firstNum + " times " + secondNum + " equals " + firstNum * secondNum
    );
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
0 times 0 equals 0
0 times 1 equals 0
...
1 times 9 equals 9
```

### Custom Division Table

Nested loops can also generate a division table.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
for (var i = 100; i > 10; i -= 10) {
  for (var j = 10; j > 4; j -= 5) {
    console.log(i + " divided by " + j + " equals " + i / j);
  }
}
```

**Output:**

```
100 divided by 10 equals 10
100 divided by 5 equals 20
...
20 divided by 5 equals 4
```

### Styling Console Output with CSS

To visualize loops in a styled manner, you can use CSS in the console.

#### Code Example:

```javascript
var cubes = "ABCDEFG";
for (var i = 0; i < cubes.length; i++) {
  var styles =
    "font-size: 40px; border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid blue; background: pink; color: purple";
  console.log("%c" + cubes[i], styles);
}
```

**Output:** Styled letters A to G in the console.

### Uses of Loops in Everyday Development

- **E-commerce Sites**: Display products in a grid.
- **Email Clients**: Format and display emails.
- **Calendars**: Show days and events.
- **Blog Posts**: Display titles on the homepage.
- **Social Media Posts**: Show posts based on conditions.
