# HTTP and HTTPS üì°üîí

- **Purpose**: Transfers web resources like HTML documents, images, etc.
- **Request-Response Cycle**: Client sends a request, server responds.
- **HTTP Methods**: GET (retrieve), POST (send data), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).
- **Path**: Location of the resource on the server.
- **Versions**: Most used are 1.1 and 2.0.
- **Headers**: Additional info about the request and client.
- **Body** (Content): This is the main part of the response, containing the actual data you requested.
- **Status Codes**: Indicate request success or failure.

## Explanation

### HTTP Requests & Responses

- **Requests:** Sent by your browser, they specify what information or action is needed (e.g., GET /images/product.jpg to retrieve an image).
- **Responses:** Sent by the server, they contain the requested data (e.g., the image file) or a status code indicating success (200 OK) or error (404 Not Found).

**Methods (Actions):**

- GET: Retrieves information from the server (like getting the menu).
- POST: Sends data to the server (like sending your pizza order).
- PUT: Updates existing data on the server (less common).
- DELETE: Removes a resource from the server (like deleting an old email).

**Status Codes (Results):**

- 1xx: Informational (server is processing the request).
- 2xx: Success (request processed successfully).
- 3xx: Redirection (resource has moved to a different location).
- 4xx: Client Error (error in the request itself).
- 5xx: Server Error (error on the server's side).

**Headers (Extra Information):** These provide additional details about the request and response, like the content type (text/html, image/jpeg) or language preference.

**Body (Content):** This is the main part of the response, containing the actual data you requested (e.g., the HTML code for a webpage).

### Securing the Web with HTTPS

When you see a lock icon in your browser address bar, it means HTTPS is being used. HTTPS encrypts communication between your browser and the server, scrambling the data to ensure the security of sensitive information like credit card details . Imagine sending your pizza order in a secret code only the pizzeria can understand!

## Examples

### The Request-Response Cycle

Imagine you're ordering pizza online:

1. **Placing the Order (Request):** You visit the website. Your browser sends an HTTP request (GET method) to the server, requesting the menu (path: /menu/pizzas/). This request includes:

   - Method: GET (to retrieve information)
   - Path: /menu/pizzas/ (specifies the pizza menu section)
   - Version: HTTP/1.1 (the protocol version)

2. **Sending the Order to the Kitchen (Response):** The server receives your request, fetches the pizza menu data, and sends it back to your browser (response). This response contains:

   - Status Code: 200 OK (request processed successfully) ‚úÖ
   - Headers: Content-Type: text/html (specifies the data type)
   - Body: The HTML code for the pizza menu page, showcasing available pizzas with descriptions and prices.

3. **Choosing Your Toppings (Additional Requests):** You browse the menu and click on a topping. This sends another GET request for details about that topping. The server responds with confirmation or additional information.

4. **Placing the Final Order (POST Request):** Once you've selected your pizza and toppings, you click the "Order Now" button. This triggers a POST request containing all your order details (pizza type, size, toppings, etc.). Think of it as sending a confirmation to the kitchen!

   - Method: POST (to send data)
   - Path: /orders/ (specifies the order submission path)
   - Version: HTTP/1.1 (the protocol version)
   - Headers: Content-Type: application/json (or another data format)
   - Body: {"pizza_type": "pepperoni", "size": "large", "toppings": ["mushrooms", "onions"]} (example order data in JSON format)

5. **Receiving Confirmation (Response):** The server processes your order, confirms it, and sends a response back.

   - Status Code: 201 Created (order successfully placed)
   - Body: A confirmation message with your order details and an estimated delivery time. ‚è±Ô∏è
